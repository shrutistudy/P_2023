Language Fundamental:-
--------------------

Introduction:-
------------

> Python is a general purpose of high level programming laguage.

    		Low Level:-

			Binary num lang:== 0,1

			A- 01000001

			Developement :- It's very very slow
			Production   :- It's very very fast.


			Middle Level:-
			-----------

			Use Converter :- Convert english laguage to binary number

			Development :- Very very fast.
			Production:- Very very slow.


			High Level:-
			----------

			Oops(Object Orient Programming) and Pops(Procedure Oriented Programming)

			oops :- Rule and Regulation very very strict.(too many special char and symbol use) :- Java, C, Golang , .net

			pops:- Not a difficult rules.(very less amount of special char use) :- Python, c++, perl (scripting)

			Development :- Very very fast.

2.Python was developed by Guido Van Rossam in 1989 while working at National Research Insititue at Netherland.

3. In officially python was made available to public in 1991 feb 20

void main()
{
	print("HI T-44")
}


Python:-
-------
print("HI T-44")
